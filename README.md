## Violence-Detection 

This repository contains code for the paper *Flow Accumulation based violence detection model using transformers*. The proposed model uses a novel feature extraction method from violent video frames utilizing optical flow accumulation through binary thresholding.

Flow Accumulated Frames contain the following features
- Temporal information of violent actions
- Background information removal
- Highlighting actions with minimal change in pixel information

The code in this repository was trained and tested on the Hockey Fights Dataset by Nievas et al.

The proposed model achieved a validation accuracy of 98.44% on the dataset.
